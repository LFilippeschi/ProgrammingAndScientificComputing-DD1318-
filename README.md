# ProgrammingAndScientificComputing-DD1318-

## KTH course.

During the summer after the first year in my programme I followed this course to learn python and then moved on to do the Udacity machine learning course.
I followed the syllabus of the course except a few exercises that I didn't do. 

I changed the mandelbrot assignment so that I could play sounds based on what is shown on the screen. 
My idea was to make a song as the function was zooming in based on the mandelbrot. It didn't turn out as I intended because the computation of each frame takes a very long time and I couldn't do it in real time. My next step would have been to create a video from all the frames and then create a "song" based on the output.

Intended learning outcomes of the course: 
 - follow the rules in the syntax of the programming language 
 - apply and account for rules for good programming style (such as user-friendliness, comments, error handling, structuring, flexibility) 
 - discover and correct programming errors 
 - modify given programs 
 - transfer data between file and program 
 - identify the need of and use control structures (conditional statements and loops) 
 - divide a larger problem into manageable parts and design functions for these 
 - use the data structures that are embedded in the programming language, as well as choose data structures that fit for the current problem 
 - use classes as well as design own classes 
 - ~~review others' programs~~
 - handle matrices and use matrix operations 
 - use built-in functions from libraries for technical computations and visualisation 
 - differentiate and integrate functions numerically 
 - solve scalar equations numerically 
 - solve large linear equation system 
 - use the least squares method 
 - solve optimisation problems numerically 
 - write and plot functions of complex numbers 
 - plot curves 
 - plot surfaces 
 - ~~make frequency analysis FFT, of vectors/sound and matrices/images~~ 
 - use programming to solve problems 
 - apply the problem solving methodology also in other fields than programming 
 - ~~discuss software development with experts~~ 
 - utilise the computer as aid for mathematical computations and visualisation in other courses.
